# Economics_UrbanBeauty

An attempt to measure **Urban Beauty** using a **Gravitational Index**.

The idea is to assign *weights* to each neighborhood in a city based on the amount of beauty it possesses. A proxy for beauty is determined by the quantity of historical, cultural, and recreational attractions (scenic sites) near the center of each neighborhood.

It is expected that neighborhoods with a higher *weight* will have higher average housing prices and higher average wages.

To accomplish this, the steps bellow must be followed:

## Step 1 - Obtaining Centers

The city under study can be divided into various entities, notably 'Bairros' (Neighborhoods) and 'Macrozonas' (Macrozones), which will be central to our analysis. We have the option to utilize either the geometric center or the population center of this subdivisions. In this project, we'll explore all possibilities and determine which yields the most promising results.

#### Geometric Center
By acquiring the shapefiles of the Neighborhoods and Macrozones, we gain access to their polygons and consequently their respective vertices.

With this information, it's possible to compute the Area and the Center of these forms using the expressions bellow

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i}y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}y_{i})
$$

$$
C_{x} = \frac{1}{6A} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i}+x_{i+1})(x_{i}y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}y_{i})
$$

$$
C_{y} = \frac{1}{6A} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (y_{i}+y_{i+1})(x_{i}y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}y_{i})
$$

where:
- \( A \) is the area of the polygon,
- \( x \) is the Longitude of the vertex,
- \( y \) is the Latitude of the vertex,
- \( Cx \) is the Longitude of the center,
- \( Cy \) is the Latitude of the center.
  

#### Populacional Center
The data for populacional density was taken from 2020 NASA GPW on [https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4 ] and the center of each Neighborhood and Macrozone was obtained via QGIS and then exported do a .xlsx file.

## Step 2 - Obtaining coordinates of Scenic Locations 

In this work, the following urban spaces will be defined as Scenic Locations:
Parks, Museums, Memorials, and Historical-Cultural Heritage sites, as designated by the Porto Alegre City Hall. Parks and squares are considered Recreational Locations, while museums, memorials, and historical-cultural heritage sites are considered Historical Locations. The coordinates were obtained by manually pinning the locations on Google Maps.

## Step 3 - Computing the Gravitacional Index

This index was based on Carlino & Saiz paper https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1293550. 
The index express how much historicity or beauty is near the center of the division selected, higer the value, the more concentrated is the beaty of the division, so it's expected that beautiful neighborhoods have a high index.

The index is constructed as bellow:

$$
GI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{d^2_i}
$$

where:
- \( GI \) is the gravitational index,
- \( d \) is the distance beetween the center and the specific attraction.

The index as it is above does not adress the quality of the diferent interest sites (a park can be better than another parl, for example) so we utilized the index below to try to adress this issue.

$$
GI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{s_{i}}{d^2_i}
$$

where:
- \( s \) is the score of the park i,

The score is based on diferentt itens:

- Proximity of the park in relationship to the 'Orla do Gua√≠ba' wich is the main Scenic Location of Porto Alegre,
- Quality of Infraestructure of the park,
- Size of the park.

All these itens were normalized using max-min method, so the score is always beetween 0 and 1.

## Step 4 - Review Data

## Step 5 - Correlation Analysis
