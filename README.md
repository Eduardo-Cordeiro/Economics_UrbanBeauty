# Economics_UrbanBeauty

An attempt to measure **Urban Beauty** using a **Gravitational Index**.

The idea is to assign *weights* to each neighborhood in a city based on the amount of beauty it possesses. A proxy for beauty is determined by the quantity of historical, cultural, and recreational attractions near the center of each neighborhood.

It is expected that neighborhoods with a higher *weight* will have higher average housing prices and higher average wages.

To accomplish this, the following steps need to be followed:

## Step 1 - Obtaining Centers

We can use the geometric center of a city subdivison or the populacional center. In this project, we'll use both and copmpare wich one have the best results.
  
  ### Step1.1

## Step 2 - Obtaining coordinates of historical and recreational sites

## Step 3 - Compute the Gravitacional Index

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force,
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses,
- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.

## Step 4 - Review Data

## Step 5 - Correlation Analysis
