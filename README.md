# Economics_UrbanBeauty

An attempt to measure **Urban Beauty** using a **Gravitational Index**.

The idea is to assign *weights* to each neighborhood in a city based on the amount of beauty it possesses. A proxy for beauty is determined by the quantity of historical, cultural, and recreational attractions near the center of each neighborhood.

It is expected that neighborhoods with a higher *weight* will have higher average housing prices and higher average wages.

To accomplish this, the steps bellow must be followed:

## Step 1 - Obtaining Centers

We can use the geometric center or the populacional center. In this project, we'll use both and comppare wich one have the best results.
  
  #### Geometric Center

  #### Populacional Center

## Step 2 - Obtaining coordinates of historical and recreational sites

## Step 3 - Compute the Gravitacional Index

$$
GI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{d^2_i}
$$

where:
- \( GI \) is the gravitational index,
- \( d \) is the distance beetween the center and the specific attraction


## Step 4 - Review Data

## Step 5 - Correlation Analysis
